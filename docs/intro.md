# Welcome

Welcome to the Tarant user guide! This guide shows you how to get started on this actor model framework.

## What is Tarant?

Tarant is an extensible full-stack actor model that allows you to build aplications focusing in the bussiness logic and allowing the platform to abstract other concepts that are common to all applications (ex. serialization, rendering, networking) through our modules.

## Is Tarant for me?

if you are thinking on creating applications you should give it a try.
